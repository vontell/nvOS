# nvOS

nvOS is a collection of tools that can be used to perform quantum information and characterization experiments on Nitrogen-vacancy centers in Diamond. The available tools include Rabi oscillation experiments, a pulse sequence library, qubit initialization features, and more. See the "learn" folder for README's and iPython notebooks that explain how these things work.

Included in this repo is also a server and client for easily running experiments and accessing data.

These experiments and tools are made possible by the MIT Quantum Photonics Group, Texas Instruments, and the open source ARTIQ codebase.
